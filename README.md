# Project Name

This project is an example of an event-driven microservices architecture using Docker, Kubernetes, Kafka, Express.js, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL with TypeORM. It contains two services (`service-1` and `service-2`) and demonstrates inter-service communication via Kafka topics.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Kubernetes (Minikube or a managed Kubernetes cluster)
- Skaffold (optional, for development with hot reloading)
- An ingress controller (optional, for URL-based routing)
- kafkacat (optional, for testing Kafka topics)

## Setting Up the Project

1.  Clone the repository:

shCopy code

`git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url/project-name.git
cd project-name`

1.  Set up the Docker environment to use the Minikube Docker daemon:

shCopy code

`minikube start --driver=<your_preferred_driver>
minikube docker-env | Invoke-Expression`

(On macOS or Linux, use `eval $(minikube docker-env)` instead of `minikube docker-env | Invoke-Expression`.)

1.  Build and run the services in Docker:

shCopy code

`docker-compose up --build`

1.  (Optional) Install and enable the ingress controller for your Kubernetes cluster:

shCopy code

`minikube addons enable ingress`

1.  Deploy the services to your Kubernetes cluster:

shCopy code

`kubectl apply -f k8s/`

1.  (Optional) Add a mapping to your `/etc/hosts` file (or `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows) to route requests to your ingress domain:

shCopy code

`echo "$(minikube ip) myapp.local" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts`

## Running the Project in Development Mode

1.  Set up your Docker environment to use the Minikube Docker daemon:

shCopy code

`minikube start --driver=<your_preferred_driver>
minikube docker-env | Invoke-Expression`

(On macOS or Linux, use `eval $(minikube docker-env)` instead of `minikube docker-env | Invoke-Expression`.)

1.  Run Skaffold in development mode:

shCopy code

`skaffold dev`

Skaffold will watch for code changes, rebuild the Docker images, and redeploy your application to the Minikube cluster automatically.

## Testing Kafka Topics

To test the Kafka topic communication, you can use the `kafkacat` utility. Install `kafkacat` following the instructions for your platform: <https://github.com/edenhill/kafkacat>

1.  Produce a message to a Kafka topic:

shCopy code

`kafkacat -P -b localhost:9092 -t my-topic`

Type a message, press Enter, and then press Ctrl+C to exit.

1.  Consume messages from a Kafka topic:

shCopy code

`kafkacat -C -b localhost:9092 -t my-topic`

Press Ctrl+C to exit.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while setting up or running the project, consider the following troubleshooting tips:

1.  Verify that all required software is installed and running correctly, including Docker, Kubernetes, Skaffold, and the ingress controller.

2.  Check the logs of your services and the ingress controller for any errors or issues:

shCopy code

`kubectl logs <pod_name> -f`

Replace `<pod_name>` with the name of the pod you want to check.

1.  Ensure your Kubernetes resources are correctly configured, including services, deployments, and the ingress resource.

2.  If you're using Minikube, ensure that your system is properly configured to use the Minikube Docker daemon and that the cluster is running.

3.  If you're using an ingress controller, make sure the ingress resource is properly configured, and the domain is mapped to the correct IP address in your `/etc/hosts` file.

4.  If you encounter issues with Kafka topics, double-check your Kafka and Zookeeper configurations, and ensure that the required ports are exposed and accessible.

5.  For development mode with hot reloading, ensure that Skaffold is set up correctly and that your project structure is compatible with the `skaffold.yaml` file.

If you continue to experience issues, feel free to open an issue in the project repository or seek help from the community.
